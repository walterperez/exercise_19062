Coding Exercise
=======

A very simple coding exercise using JavaScript

This exercise should take no more than 30 minutes to complete.

Objective
======

Implement the `format` method in the file [dateFormatter.js](https://github.com/timt/exercise_1904/blob/master/src/dateFormatter.js)

    const format = (dateToFormatTimeMillis, systemDateTimeMillis) => {}

The `format` method takes a `datetime to format` and the `current system datetime` in milliseconds as inputs.

The `format` method implementation should return a formatted string as follows:
* When the date is the current system date return the string `'TODAY'`
* When the date is not current system date return a formatted date string in the format `'DD/MM/YYYY'`
